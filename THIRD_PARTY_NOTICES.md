## Waveshare — ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-2.8

- **Publisher:** Waveshare
- **Product page:** https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-2.8

**License status (as of 2025-09-30, JST):**
The product wiki describes hardware, usage and demo availability, but it does **not** state an explicit software license for the demo sources linked from the page. After downloading any archive, please inspect it for `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`, or `README` files. If no license is included, treat the content as **no redistribution rights granted** and use only for personal evaluation unless you obtain permission from Waveshare.

**We do not include or redistribute Waveshare’s demo sources.**
If you choose to use them locally, fetch them yourself (e.g., via a helper script such as `scripts/get-source.sh`). Do **not** publish those sources or binaries derived from them unless Waveshare’s license terms explicitly permit it.

### Guidance for users of this repository

1. This repository contains only my original work. Third-party sources are **not** vendored.
2. If you intend to **publish** binaries that incorporate third-party code, you must comply with the upstream license (if any).
3. If the downloaded archive contains a license file, follow its terms. If it does not, **avoid redistribution** and consider contacting Waveshare for clarification.
4. Keep this notice up to date. If Waveshare later publishes explicit license terms, update this document with the license name and required notices.
